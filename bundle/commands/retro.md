# Retrospective

Produce a complete, presentation-ready **retrospective package** — not a single document, but a
navigable **directory** of grouped change records, a change inventory, a timeline, an open-items
register, and speaker-ready presentation material — covering a chosen period of work.

Where `/weekly-summary` documents *one week* from git, `/retro` **aggregates** across one or more
weeks (defaulting to the last two), cross-referencing the weekly summaries, the task plans, and the
raw git history into a stakeholder-facing retrospective you can read, verify independently, and
present today.

## Usage

```
/retro                          Last two weeks (default)
/retro 3 weeks                  Last N weeks ending today
/retro last week                A single week
/retro 2026-06-01..2026-06-14   An explicit date range (inclusive)
/retro since 2026-06-01         From a date through today
/retro update                   Extend the most recent retro through today (incremental)
/retro --new                    Force a brand-new package even if a recent one overlaps
/retro Q2 auth hardening        N weeks (default 2) + a theme hint to frame the narrative
```

**Re-running is incremental by default.** If a recent retrospective package already exists, `/retro`
**extends it** — it appends only the changes/commits that landed since the package was last updated,
adds new `CHANGE-NN` records continuing the numbering, recomputes the aggregate views, and preserves
every existing record and any manual notes. It does **not** rebuild records that are already written.
Use `--new` to force a fresh, separate package, or pass an explicit `{date}..{date}` range to target
a specific window.

Anything in `$ARGUMENTS` that is **not** a recognized period token or flag is treated as a **theme
hint** — free text used to frame the executive narrative and grouping, never to filter out changes.

## Instructions

You are a senior engineering analyst preparing a formal technical retrospective. Your output is a
**directory of linked Markdown files**, structured so a presenter can open any change in one click
during a meeting and so a reader who was *not present* can understand everything cold.

### Input

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

### Phase 0 — Resolve the period and output location

1. **Parse the period** from `$ARGUMENTS` (resolve relative references with the shell so they are
   unambiguous):
   - **Empty** → last 14 days, i.e. `{today − 13 days}` → `{today}`.
   - `N weeks` / `N week` → last `N × 7` days ending today.
   - `last week` → the previous Monday–Sunday week.
   - `since {date}` → `{date}` → today.
   - `{date}..{date}` → that explicit inclusive range.
   - A bare date → the Monday–Sunday week containing it.

   ```bash
   date +%F                      # today
   date -d "13 days ago" +%F     # default window start
   date -d "N weeks ago" +%F     # N-week window start
   ```

2. **Separate the theme hint.** Strip recognized period tokens from `$ARGUMENTS`; whatever remains
   is the theme hint. If empty, infer the theme yourself in Phase 2.

3. **Decide: extend an existing package, or create a new one.** List `docs/retrospectives/*/`
   directories (each named `{START}_to_{END}`). Then:

   - **`--new` flag present** → skip straight to creating a new package (below).
   - **`update` keyword, or no period token given** → find the **most recent** existing package
     (latest `END` in its name) and **extend it** (see Phase 1b). This is the default for a bare
     `/retro` re-run.
   - **An explicit `{date}..{date}` or `since` range** → if a package's name matches that exact
     `START`, extend that package; otherwise create a new one for the given range.
   - **A relative window** (`N weeks`, `last week`) → if it overlaps an existing package's range,
     **extend** that package (advancing its `END` to today); otherwise create a new one.

   **Create a new package** → make `docs/retrospectives/{START}_to_{END}/` (and parent dirs) and
   proceed through Phase 1 → Phase 2 in full.

   **Extend a package** → keep its directory; you will advance its `END` to today, rename the
   directory to the new `{START}_to_{END}` with `git mv` (so history is preserved), and run the
   incremental path in Phase 1b before writing.

   When in doubt about which package to touch, state your choice (extend vs. new, and which folder)
   in the final report so the user can redirect you.

### Phase 1b — Incremental update (only when extending an existing package)

When extending, do **not** regenerate existing records. Instead:

1. **Read the existing package** — `README.md`, `01-change-inventory.md`, and every
   `changes/CHANGE-NN-*.md`. Note the highest `CHANGE-NN` number and collect the set of commit
   hashes already recorded (each record lists its `Commits:`). This commit set is the watermark.
2. **Find only new work** — run the Phase 1 git queries for the window `{last-covered date}` →
   `today`, then filter out any commit whose hash is already in the watermark. What remains is the
   delta. If the delta is empty, report "No new changes since {last update}" and stop without
   rewriting anything.
3. **Append, don't rewrite** — create one new `changes/CHANGE-NN-{slug}.md` per discrete new change,
   continuing the numbering from the highest existing record. Leave existing records untouched
   except to add backward `Linked changes` references where a new change genuinely affects an old one.
4. **Recompute the aggregates** — append new rows to `01-change-inventory.md`; extend
   `02-timeline.md` with the new dates; refresh `03-open-items-and-risks.md` and `04-challenges.md`
   from the combined set; update affected `by-area/*.md` pages (adding new area pages if needed);
   regenerate `presentation/` material to cover the full extended period; update the README's
   `END` date, `Generated` timestamp, weeks-covered list, and at-a-glance metrics.
5. **Preserve manual context** — never delete human-added notes or corrections in any file.

### Phase 1 — Discovery (do this silently, before writing anything)

Gather from **every** available source. The weekly summaries and task plans are the narrative
backbone; git is the source of truth that verifies and fills gaps.

1. **Weekly summaries** — read every `docs/changes/{YYYY}/{MM}/week{N}.md` whose period overlaps the
   range. These already contain daily breakdowns, initiatives, impact metrics, and documentation
   produced. Use them as the primary structure.
   - If a week in range has **no** summary file, generate that week's data inline from git (same
     queries as `/weekly-summary` Phase 1) so the retrospective has no blind spots. Note in the
     final report which weeks lacked a pre-existing summary.

2. **Task plans** — read `.claude/tasks/MASTER_PLAN.md` and each active feature's
   `.claude/tasks/{feature}/MASTER_TASKS.md`. Capture which subtasks moved to `[COMPLETED]` in the
   range, what is `[IN PROGRESS]`, and what is `[BLOCKED]` or deferred.

3. **Project context** — read `CONTEXT_MAP.md` (or the bundle equivalent) for project overview,
   active feature, known constraints, and current technical debt.

4. **Git history across the full range** (not per-week — the whole window at once):
   ```bash
   git log --after="{START} 00:00" --before="{END} 23:59:59" --format="%H|%h|%ai|%an|%s" --no-merges
   git log --after="{START} 00:00" --before="{END} 23:59:59" --stat --no-merges
   git diff --stat {first_commit}^..{last_commit}      # range churn
   git status --short                                   # uncommitted work, if range includes today
   ```

5. **Inventory every distinct change** — one entry per discrete change, task, decision, or artifact.
   Do **not** collapse distinct changes. For each, capture: area, before-state, after-state,
   rationale, implementation approach, the **challenge/obstacle** encountered and how it was
   resolved, verification method, and dependencies on other changes. Flag anything ambiguous or
   where context is incomplete rather than inventing detail.

6. **Group** the inventory into logical domains/areas (backend, frontend, infra, config, docs,
   tests, tooling, etc.) and into initiatives/work-streams (matching the weekly summaries' "Active
   initiatives" where possible).

### Phase 2 — Write the retrospective package

Write these files into the output directory. **Every file is cross-linked** with relative Markdown
links so the package is navigable during a live presentation.

**Theme:** {theme hint, or inferred theme}
**Branch:** `{branch}`  ·  **Generated:** {now}
**Weeks covered:** {list of week files used; flag any generated inline}

## Executive overview
{8–12 sentences: the sprint goal/theme; what was delivered vs what remains open;
the single biggest technical decision and why; overall risk posture.}

## Navigate
- 📋 [Change inventory](01-change-inventory.md) — {N} changes
- 🕐 [Timeline](02-timeline.md)

```

#### `01-change-inventory.md` — master table

One row per discrete change; the title links to its record.

```markdown
# Change inventory — {START} → {END}

| # | Area | Change | Status | Risk | Record |
|---|------|--------|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | backend | {title} | DONE | LOW | [CHANGE-01](changes/CHANGE-01-{slug}.md) |
| 2 | infra | {title} | IN PROGRESS | MEDIUM | [CHANGE-02](changes/CHANGE-02-{slug}.md) |
```

- **Status:** `DONE` / `IN PROGRESS` / `REVERTED` / `DEFERRED`
- **Risk:** `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH`

#### `changes/CHANGE-NN-{slug}.md` — one per change (self-contained)

```markdown
# CHANGE-{NN}: {Title}

[← Inventory](../01-change-inventory.md) · Area: **{area}** · Status: **{status}** · Risk: **{risk}**

**Files / components affected:** {every file, module, or system touched — concrete paths}
**Commits:** {short hashes, dated}

## Before
{The exact prior state — what existed, what was the problem or gap.}

## After
{The new state — what was built, modified, or removed.}

## Why
{What triggered this change; what problem it solves.}

## How
{Implementation approach — key decisions, patterns used, tradeoffs made.}

## Challenge
{The obstacle hit (technical, ambiguity, dependency) and how it was resolved.
If none, say "Straightforward — no notable obstacle."}

## Verification
{How a reader can independently confirm this works — command to run, file to inspect,
test to read, commit to diff. Reference concrete artifacts.}

## Linked changes
{Other CHANGE-NN records this depends on or affects, as relative links.}
```

Write **one record per inventory row** — no omissions, even minor config tweaks or small refactors.

#### `02-timeline.md` — chronological narrative

A day-by-day (or commit-cluster) sequence across the full range, each entry linking to the relevant
CHANGE records. Reconstruct from commit dates and the weekly summaries' daily breakdowns.

#### `03-open-items-and-risks.md`

- Work started but not finished (link to the CHANGE record and the task plan).
- Technical debt introduced this period.
- Decisions that need follow-up or stakeholder sign-off.
- Uncommitted work, if the range includes today.

#### `04-challenges.md`

A consolidated view of the obstacles surfaced in the per-change `## Challenge` sections — the
"war stories" for the retrospective discussion. Group by theme; link back to each CHANGE record.

#### `by-area/{area}.md` — grouped index

One page per area present, listing its CHANGE records with one-line summaries, so the presenter can
drill into a single domain on demand.

#### `presentation/slides.md` and `presentation/speaker-notes.md`

- **slides.md** — a slide-by-slide outline: title, theme, "what we shipped", per-initiative slides,
  challenges slide, open-items slide, next-steps slide. Each slide cites the CHANGE records behind it.
- **speaker-notes.md** — an ordered walkthrough with talking points and demo cues ("open
  CHANGE-04 to show the before/after"), timed for a short stakeholder presentation.

### Phase 3 — Report

After writing the package, report to the user:
- The output directory path, and whether this was a **new package** or an **extension** of an
  existing one (and if extended: how many new `CHANGE-NN` records were appended, or that there were
  no new changes since the last update).
- A tree of the files created/updated.
- Counts: changes inventoried, commits covered, areas, open items.
- Any weeks in range that lacked a pre-existing weekly summary (generated inline).
- Anything flagged as ambiguous or incomplete that needs the user's confirmation.
- A one-line suggestion to run `/weekly-summary` for any missing week so future retros are richer.

### Principles

- **No omission.** Every distinct change gets its own record — minor tweaks included. Never collapse
  distinct changes into one entry.
- **Verifiable.** Every claim traces to a commit hash, a file diff, a task status, or a weekly
  summary. Reference concrete artifacts; never invent detail. If something is unclear, say so
  explicitly in that section.
- **Self-contained per file.** Each CHANGE record must stand alone — a reader opening it cold,
  mid-presentation, should understand the whole change without the rest of the package.
- **Navigable.** Everything is cross-linked with relative paths. The README is the single entry
  point; no file is an orphan.
- **Weekly summaries are the backbone, git is the truth.** Prefer the narrative already captured in
  `docs/changes/`; use git to verify it and fill any gaps.
- **Incremental by default.** Re-running extends the most recent package — it appends new `CHANGE-NN`
  records for work that landed since the last update and recomputes the aggregate views, without
  rewriting existing records or deleting human-added notes. Use `--new` to force a fresh package.
- **Audience-aware.** Technical language for a developer audience in the change records; the
  presentation/ material is framed for stakeholders.
